# Movie-Ticket-Booking
A responsive Movie Ticket Booking website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can select a movie, choose seats from an interactive layout, and see the total price instantly. Selections are saved with localStorage. Great project for beginners to practice DOM manipulation and UI design.
